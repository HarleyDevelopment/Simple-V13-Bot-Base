# Simple-V13-Bot-Base
This **Simple Base** is used for learning how to make a bot, creating a bot or simply saving you time whilst making a bot. 

## TOS
When using please give credits of the base. It doesn't need to be huge, just my name & discord invite somewhere within a credits command is completely fine.

## Information
Want to find a bot using this template and a load more cool commands and events, possibly even using a database? Then come and check out Harley's Development's official Discord. You can find the Discord by using any of the two links!

You are also allowed to fork this and make changes, thanks! (Remember to give credits!)
